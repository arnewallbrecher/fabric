<p>The compressional areas are drawn with <a href="cont1zc5.htm">contour lines</a>
in the <a href="plot7jhw.htm">Lambert projection</a>. These lines separate
areas with different amounts of compression (&gt;20%, &gt;40%, &gt;60%, &gt;80%,
&gt; 95%).</p>
        
<p>In the menu 'Colour\Contour lines' you can also choose different grades 
 of gray for the plot of <a href="cont1zc5.htm">contour lines</a>.</p>
        
<p>In the menu ‚<a href="cont15k7.htm">Contouring methods</a>‚ further methods 
 for the visualisation of <a href="cont3gpx.htm">counting densities</a> are 
 offered.</p>
        
<p>The menu ‚<a href="cont28vb.htm">smoothing factor</a> is used only for 
 the <a href="cont2raq.htm">Scalar product-method</a> aktiv.<br>
   </p>
     
<p>It is also possible to draw <a href="closed_polyline.html">closed polylines</a>
which follow the edges between  the colours. These polylines can be saved
in a <a href="Dxf-Format.html">*.dxf file</a>. This file can be treated with
Autocad, CorelDraw, or any other graphic programm which reads dxf-files.<br>
   The procedure is:  Click  'Method of contouring/Distance method/In steps' 
 and wait until the diagram is finished. Then click 'Graphic/Save/DXF'. On 
 the right side a panel appears, in which the saved coordinates and the radius 
 are shown. Change the numbers, if necessary. Click on 'Create plot file'
 and type the name of the plot file. Wait until the polylines appear. Now
you can import the dxf file to a graphic program. </p>
        
<p>The Menu ‚<a href="plot18h7.htm">Diagram</a>‚ ist the same as in the other 
 programs.</p>
        
<p>The calculated values 'maximum' and 'minimum' allow an estimation of the 
 consistency of the data set. In the ideal case the maximum equals the number 
 of data, and the minimum is zero.</p>
