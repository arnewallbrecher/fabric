<p>In this part of the program the coordinates of the centre points of
the markers are found. After clicking&nbsp; 'Start' you are asked to
import a bitmap. To do so, click the menu <a href="fry-0cry.htm">'import
picture</a>'</p>
<p>Procedure for the <a href="fry-238l.htm">conventional Fry method</a>:<br>
When the picture appeares on the screen, all centres of the markers are
clicked one after the other. The centres are found just by visual
estimate. The coordinates of these points are listed on the right side.</p>
<p>Procedure for the <a href="fry-7dut.htm">normalized Fry method</a>:<br>
When the picture appears on the screen, first the centre of a marker is
clicked, then a point of the margin of the marker. The program
calculates the radius of the marker from these two data. The centre is
found by visual estimate. Continue with all other markers. The
coordinates and the radii of the markers are listed on the right side.</p>
<p>Press the button 'terminate input of points' after clicking on the
last point. Now the menu 'save points' is active which saves the data
in a file.<br>
The colour of the points can be changed with the option <a
 href="file:///C:/Users/User/Documents/Delphi%20Quellen/Fabric7/Help_Files/Html/html/English/plot3qlh.htm">Colour</a>.<br>
The button 'Plot' opens the graphic evaluation.</p>
