<p>In the menu <a href="calc8tid.htm">'data input</a>' you choose the
drive which contains the data or 'manual' if you want to add new data.
In the menu ‚<a href="calc3epa.htm">calculations</a>‚ you choose the
type of calculation.</p>
<p>The following <a href="calc3epa.htm">calculations</a> can be
carried out:</p>
<p>Calculation of the intersection line of 2 planes,<br>
Calculation of the angle between 2 planes,<br>
Calculation of the angle between two lineations,<br>
Calculation of a plane from 2 lineations,<br>
Calculation of the normal on two lineations.<br>
Pitch angle from a lineation.<br>
Lineation from a pitch angle.<br>
Azimuth to strike (plane).<br>
Azimuth to strike (linear).<br>
Strike to azimuth (plane).<br>
Strike to azimuth (linear).<br>
</p>
For manual input you also have to choose the scale in which the angles
have been measured (<a href="calc2ejo.htm">1..360°</a> or <a
 href="calc3bc4.htm">1..400gon</a>). For <a href="calc8tid.htm">data
input</a> this information is not necessary, because all saved data
have the 1..360° scale.
<p>The options chosen are shown in the line at the bottom. When all
options have been chosen, the button 'continue' becomes active. It
leads to the next form.</p>
