<P><A NAME="überarbeiten"></A><B>Erase Data</B></P>

<P>With this option you can erase data from the plot which obviously do not fit into the data set (measurement errors or superposition of more than one stress field) (<A HREF="rota1d0y.htm">Wallbrecher et al. 1996</A>). To do this, you have to know the orientation of the principal stress axes which can be found with the <A HREF="pale554i.htm">dihedra method</A>. s<SUB>1</SUB> and s<SUB>3</SUB> are filled in the fields on the right side of the plot area. With these stresses and a <A HREF="hoep9stu.htm">shape factor</A> of the paleo stress-ellipsoid which has to be estimated, trajectories of the maximum resolved shear stresses (<A HREF="hoep2lo3.htm">MRSS</A>) are calculated for 316 evenly distributed planes. You can put in two numbers for the lower and upper limits of the shape factor, so you receive two sets of trajectories. All data with arrows pointing outside of these trajectories can be erased by clicking on them. With the button 'finish correction' the menus 'save' and 'print' become active. Both sets of data, the erased and the remaining, can be saved in files and/or printed.</P>

<P>The menu ‚<A HREF="plot18h7.htm">Diagram</A>‚ contains the same options as the previous programs.</P>
