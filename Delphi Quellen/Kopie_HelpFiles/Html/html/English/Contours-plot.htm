<p><a name="plotiso"></a><b>Plot of Density Contours</b></p>
     
<p>The interval of steps between the <a href="cont1zc5.htm">contour lines</a>
 can be done either<u> </u>in <a href="cont91ph.htm">multiples of even distribution</a>
 with a <a href="cont9cx4.htm">logarithmic contour interval</a> or in a <a
 href="cont6bjo.htm">user defined contour interval</a>. In the first case
 five contour lines are calculated and automatically plotted. The steps between
 the contour lines are arranged in a logarithmic scale between 1 and the
maximum  <a href="cont3gpx.htm">counting density</a>. in the first option
the size  of the counting calotte is fitted to the number of data, in the
second option  it is defined manually.<br>
   In the menu 'Colour\Contour lines' you can also choose different grades 
of gray for the plot of <a href="cont1zc5.htm">contour lines</a>.<br>
   In the menu ‚Lines‚ the <a href="plot4h4g.htm">line type</a> for each
contour  line can be changed.<br>
   In the menu ‚<a href="cont15k7.htm">Contouring methods</a>‚ further methods
 for the visualisation of <a href="cont3gpx.htm">counting densities</a> are
 offered.<br>
   The menu ‚<a href="cont28vb.htm">smoothing factor</a> is used only for 
the <a href="cont2raq.htm">Scalar product-method</a> .</p>
   
<p>It is also possible to draw <a href="closed_polyline.html">closed polylines</a>
which follow the edges between  the colours. These polylines can be saved
in a <a href="Dxf-Format.html">*.dxf file</a>. This file can be treated with
Autocad, CorelDraw, or any other graphic programm which reads dxf-files.<br>
  The procedure is:  Click  'Method of contouring/Distance method/In steps'
 and wait until the diagram is finished. Then click 'Graphic/Save/DXF'. On
 the right side a panel appears, in which the saved coordinates and the radius
 are shown. Change the numbers, if necessary. Click on 'Create plot file' 
and type the name of the plot file. Wait until the polylines appear. Now you
can import the Dxf file to a graphic program. </p>
   
<p> The Menu ‚<a href="plot18h7.htm">Diagram</a>‚ ist the same as in the other
programs.</p>
