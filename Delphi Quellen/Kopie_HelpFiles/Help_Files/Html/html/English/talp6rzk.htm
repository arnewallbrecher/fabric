<P>A picture of the folded layers must exist as a pixel-graphic (*.bmp oder *.jpg) in a file or on the clipboard. In order to draw the <A HREF="talp7b39.htm">isogons</A> ,the axial plane of the fold must be in vertical position. First click an a piont which shall become the new centre of the graphic, then press the button "New Centre point". Then click on the hinge point of a folded layer and press the button "1st point" Do the same with the second folded layer. The program will rotate the fold and the two points are now in a vertical position. Instaed of the cursor, a straight line with inclination of 10° with a point on it appears. Drag this line until this point becomes the point of contact with the fold, then press the button "1<SUP>st</SUP> point". Do the same with the second folded layer. Now the <A HREF="talp7b39.htm">isogon</A> is plotted, and a line with inclination of 20° appears. Do the same procedure with this tangent. In this way all possible <A HREF="talp7b39.htm">isogons</A> are plotted. When the angle becomes so steep that no Tangent is possible, press the button "end". Open the graphic form with the button "plot".</P>
