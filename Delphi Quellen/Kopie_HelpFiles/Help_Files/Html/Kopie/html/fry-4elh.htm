<P>This method can be applied to a plane that contains originally randomly distributed points which changed their position during flattening or shearing. </P>

<P>Suitable material for the method should therefore contain markes distributed in a matrix. Fabrics which are strongly grain supported are therefore not suitable. For the centre points of these markers the coordinates are calculated and saved. The graphic evaluation is as follows: All centre points are drawn on a sheet of paper. Next a cross is drawn on a transparent overlay. This cross is centered on the first centre point and all other point are copied on the overlay. This procedure is continued with all the other points. The result is an elliptical area in the centre which contains no or only very few points. This area resembles the strain ellipse. This procedure has been programmed. The user only has to set up a file which contains the coordinates of the original centre points.</P>
