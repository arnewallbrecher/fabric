<P><A NAME="glättung"></A><B>Smoothing Factor:</B></P>

<P>With an increasing smoothing factor you improve the smoothness of the <A HREF="cont1zc5.htm">contour lines</A>. This goes together with a loss of details. You have to find the optimum  by comparison with a diagram plotted with the <A HREF="cont5fj9.htm">counting calotte</A> method. This comparison can easily be done by overlay with a <A HREF="cont5fj9.htm">counting calotte</A> diagram. by applying the the options '<A HREF="plot7y26.htm">copy</A>‚ and ‚<A HREF="plot4qsl.htm">load from clipboard</A>‚ of the menu '<A HREF="plot18h7.htm">graphic</A>'. This comparison with diagrams plotted with various smoothing factors lets you find the best compromise.</P>

<P>The smoothing factor is based on the influence of remote points. With an increasing smoothing factor the influence of a far away point becomes less important. This effect is reached by raising cos&gamma; (s. <A HREF="cont2raq.htm">scalar product method</A>) to a higher power:</P>

<P></P>

<P>d<SUB>i</SUB> = counting density of the i-th pixel,</P>

<P>&gamma;<SUB>j</SUB> = angle between the pixel (as projected point) and the j-th data point</P>

<P>n = number of data</P>

<P>g = smoothing factor</P>
