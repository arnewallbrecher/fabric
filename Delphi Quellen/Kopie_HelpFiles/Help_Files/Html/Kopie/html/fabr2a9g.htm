<P>Supposing the data are represented by mass points on the globe (with the masses m = 1), two axes must exist which have a maximum and a minimum moment of inertia. a third axis is normal to these two axes. with these three axes an ellipsoid can be constructed in analogy to the stress- or strain-ellipsoid. This ellipsoid is called the orientation-ellipsoid. the corresponding tensor is the <A HREF="fabr2vua.htm">orientation tensor</A>. The directions of the axes of this ellipsoid are the eigenvectors  Their lengths are the eigenvalues  with .</P>
