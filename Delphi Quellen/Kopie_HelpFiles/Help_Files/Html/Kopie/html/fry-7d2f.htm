<P>The size of the ellipse can be changed by changing the zoom factor. The colour of the points can be changed with the option 'colour of the points' The ellipse is found interactively. Determine the long axis by clicking of the end points of the estimated long axis, then click on the end points of the estimated short axis. Now the ellipse with these axes is drawn, and the <A HREF="fry-7hmh.htm">ellipticity</A> (Rf) and the angle <font face="Symbol">j </FONT>of the inclination of the long axis against a horizontal line appear in a field on the left side. The angle is measured counterclockwise from the reference line to the long axis.</P>

<P>In the menu 'constructed ellipse' the long and short axes or the size of the ellipse can be changed by dragging. The inclination can also be changed by rotation of the ellipse.</P>

<P>The image can be saved and/or printed.</P>

<P>A d'/alpha' diagram is plotted by use of the '<A HREF="fry-3t5x.htm">centre-to-centre method</A>'. This diagram plots lengths of the connection lines of all centre points against the directions of these lines.</P>

<P>All directions are put into 36 classes (sectors) with 5° width. The arithmetric means of each class minus the smallest mean are drawn as 'd' against '&alpha;'.</P>

<P>the <A HREF="fry-7hmh.htm">ellipticity</A> (Rf). is the ratio 'd<SUB>max</SUB>/d<SUB>min</SUB>'. <font face="Symbol">j </FONT>is the sector which contains d<SUB>max</SUB>.</P>

<P>Pressing the button 'Plot calculated ellipse' draws the ellipse, calculated from d' and alpha into the Fry plot. The colour of this ellipse is the same as the colour of the graph. </P>

<P>In addition a d/&alpha;-graph is plotted. This graph is calculated from the axes of the manually constructed ellipse and plotted with the same colour as this ellipse. The formula is:</P>
