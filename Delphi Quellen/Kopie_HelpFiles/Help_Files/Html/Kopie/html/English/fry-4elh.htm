<p>This method can be applied to a plane that contains originally
randomly distributed points which changed their position during
flattening or shearing. </p>
<p>Suitable material for the method should therefore contain markes
distributed in a matrix. Fabrics which are strongly grain supported are
therefore not suitable. For the centre points of these markers the
coordinates are calculated and saved. The graphic evaluation is as
follows: All centre points are drawn on a sheet of paper. Next a cross
is drawn on a transparent overlay. This cross is centered on the first
centre point and all other point are copied on the overlay. This
procedure is continued with all the other points. The result is an
elliptical area in the centre which contains no or only very few
points. This area resembles the strain ellipse. This procedure has been
programmed. The user only has to set up a file which contains the
coordinates of the original centre points.<br>
