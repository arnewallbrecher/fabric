<P>For the calculation of these coefficients we need three points on the <A HREF="four5y79.htm">quarter fold</A>. With the inflection at x=0 and y=0, three points of the quarter fold are measured with x- and y-values in integer numbers. The third of these points must be the hinge of the fold. The vergency of the fold must be eliminated by back shearing. For this reason the angle of vergency must be written into it's field.</P>

<P>Since only the ratios of the coordinates are used for calculation, the scaling is arbitrary, but you have to use integer numbers.</P>

<P>The extension for data files is “.FOU”.</P>
