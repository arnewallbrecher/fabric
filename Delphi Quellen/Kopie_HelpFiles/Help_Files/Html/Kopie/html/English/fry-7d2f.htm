<p>The size of the ellipse can be changed by changing the zoom factor.
The colour of the points can be changed with the option 'colour of the
points' The ellipse is found interactively. Determine the long axis by
clicking of the end points of the estimated long axis, then click on
the end points of the estimated short axis. Now the ellipse with these
axes is drawn, and the <a href="fry-7hmh.htm">ellipticity</a> (Rf) and
the angle <font face="Symbol">j </font>of the inclination of the long
axis against a horizontal line appear in a field on the left side. The
angle is measured counterclockwise from the reference line to the long
axis.</p>
<p>In the menu 'constructed ellipse' the long and short axes or the
size of the ellipse can be changed by dragging. The inclination can
also be changed by rotation of the ellipse.</p>
<p>The image can be saved and/or printed.</p>
<p>A d'/alpha' diagram is plotted by use of the '<a href="fry-3t5x.htm">centre-to-centre
method</a>'. This diagram plots lengths of the connection lines of all
centre points against the directions of these lines.</p>
<p>All directions are put into 36 classes (sectors) with 5° width. The
arithmetric means of each class minus the smallest mean are drawn as
'd' against '&#945;'.</p>
<p>the <a href="fry-7hmh.htm">ellipticity</a> (Rf). is the ratio 'd<sub>max</sub>/d<sub>min</sub>'.
<font face="Symbol">j </font>is the sector which contains d<sub>max</sub>.</p>
<p>Pressing the button 'Plot calculated ellipse' draws the ellipse,
calculated from d' and alpha into the Fry plot. The colour of this
ellipse is the same as the colour of the graph. </p>
<p>In addition a d/&#945;-graph is plotted. This graph is calculated from
the axes of the manually constructed ellipse and plotted with the same
colour as this ellipse. The formula is:</p>
