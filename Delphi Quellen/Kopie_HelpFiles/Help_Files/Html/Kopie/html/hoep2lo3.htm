<P>The direction on a fault plane (<A HREF="pale9nhk.htm">slickenside</A>) in which the maximum shear stress is reached. It is supposed that the <A HREF="pale22jr.htm">striations</A> on a <A HREF="pale9nhk.htm">slickenside plane</A> have the direction of the MRSS. The relation between the <A HREF="hoep9stu.htm">shape factor</A> of the stress-ellipsoid and orientation of the normal to the plane with respect to the principal stress axes and the MRSS is described by the <A HREF="rota1d0y.htm">Bott</A> formula:</P>

<P>&Theta; = angle between the strike line and the MRSS direction,</P>
