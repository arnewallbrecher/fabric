<p><big>A picture of the folded layers must exist as a pixel-graphic
(*.bmp, *.gif, *.tif, *.jpg, *.wmf, *.emf) in a file or on the
clipboard. In order to draw the <a href="1Isogons.htm">isogons</a>
,the axial plane of the fold must be
in vertical position. First click an a piont which shall become the new
centre of the graphic, then press the button "New Centre point". Then
click on the hinge point of a folded layer and press the button "1st
point" Do the same with the second folded layer. The program will
rotate the fold and the two points are now in a vertical position.
Instaed of the cursor, a straight line with inclination of 10° with a
point on it appears. Drag this line until this point becomes the point
of contact with the fold, then press the button "1<sup>st</sup> point".
Do the same with the second folded layer. Now the <a
 href="1Isogons.htm">isogon</a> is plotted, and a line with inclination
of 20° appears. Do the same procedure with this tangent. In this way
all possible <a href="1Isogons.htm">isogons</a> are plotted. When the
angle becomes so steep that no Tangent is possible, press the button
"end". Open the graphic form with the button "Plot".</big></p>
