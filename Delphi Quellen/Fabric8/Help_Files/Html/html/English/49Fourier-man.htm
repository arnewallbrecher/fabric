<p><big>For the calculation of these coefficients we need three points
on
the <a href="12QuarterFold.htm">quarter fold</a> . With the
inflection at x=0 and y=0, three points of the quarter fold are
measured with x- and y-values in integer numbers. The third of these
points must be the hinge of the fold. The vergency of the fold must be
eliminated by back shearing. For this reason the angle of vergency must
be written into it's field.<br>
Since only the ratios of the coordinates are used for calculation,
the scaling is arbitrary, but you have to use integer numbers.<br>
The extension for data files is '*.FOU'.</big></p>
