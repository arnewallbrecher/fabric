    <big><big>In this program the <a href="22Ellipticity.htm">ellipticity</a>
of the finite <a href="104strain_ellipse.html">strain-ellipse</a>  is  found,
together with its orientation towards a reference line. The  construction 
of a finite strain-ellipse is done with former rectangular markers,  like 
hinge lines and median lines of brachiopods. The resulting ellipse is  similar 
to the true strain ellipse. From its long and short diameter the ellipticity 
is calculated. </big></big><big><big>The method is explained in Fig. 1 and 
2.</big></big><br>

 When you </font><font size="+2">draw in undeformed &nbsp;state parallel
lines &nbsp;to hinge and median line through the end of a fixed line, you
receive rectangular triangles (1 to 3) lying on a Thales' circle</font>.
<font size="+2">When you shear</font> <font size="+2">&nbsp;the objects and
the Thales' circle in one deformation, the points (1 to 3) ly on an ellipse
&nbsp;which is similar to the strain ellipse, i.e. its ellipticity and inclination
are the same as those of strain ellipse. During evaluation you click on the
endpoints of the markers. The programme then creates the parallel lines &nbsp;through 
two points. You click on the intersection points of the parallels. From these 
points the ellipse is found and its <a href="22Ellipticity.htm">ellipticity</a>
and inlination calculated.&nbsp; </font><br>
