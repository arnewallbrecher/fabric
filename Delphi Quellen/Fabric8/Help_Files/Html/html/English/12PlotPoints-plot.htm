<p><big>The settings of the menus&nbsp; "<a href="3Projections.htm">Projection</a>&#8220;,
"<a href="3Symbols.htm">Symbol</a>&#8220;
und "<a href="3Farbe.htm">Colour</a>&#8220;
were saved in <a href="1Fabricini.htm">Fabric.ini.</a>
They can be changed interactively.<br>
The Menu "<a href="3Diagram.htm">Diagram</a>&#8220;
contains an option to save the plot within the frame as bitmap,
an option for overlay of the actual plot with another plot, produced by
Fabric8. The options 'Plot with a printer', 'Draw into an HPGL file',
and 'Plot into a&nbsp; DXF file' produce vectorgraphics. These options
open a&nbsp; Panel at the bottom of the right side, where
you can set the plot parameters. These are saved in <a
 href="1Fabricini.htm">Fabric.ini</a>.
Further options chose the colour of the diagram, the
frame, and the background.<br>
With the option 'Printer' the plot is printed as bitmap.</big></p>
