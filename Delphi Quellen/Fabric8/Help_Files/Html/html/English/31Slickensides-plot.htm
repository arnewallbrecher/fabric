<p><b><a name="plotharnisch"></a><big>Plot of the Slickenside Planes
and
Striations</big></b></p>
<p><big><a href="1Slickensides.htm">Slickensides</a> are presented as
great
circles. The <a href="1Striation.htm">striations</a> are dots on the
great circles. The direction of displacement is marked by an arrow
which indicates the direction of movement of the hanging block. Errors
in measurement which might result in a plot of the striation not
exactly on the great circle, are corrected automatically.<br>
The settings in the menus "<a href="3Projections.htm">Projection</a>“, "<a
 href="3Farbe.htm">Colour</a>“ and "<a href="3LineStyle.htm">Lines"</a>
have been saved in <a href="1Fabricini.htm">Fabric.ini</a>. They can
be
changed.<br>
The menu "<a href="3Diagram.htm">Diagram</a>“ contains options to save
the plot (within the rectangular frame) as a bitmap, and options to
combine the drawn plot with a plot produced with another Fabric8
program. The options "<a href="3PlotPrinter.htm">Plot with a printer"</a>,
"<a href="3HPGL.htm">Plot into a HPGL file"</a>, and "<a href="3DXF.htm">Plot
into a DXF file</a>" produce a vectorgraphic.<br>
These options open a panel (on the right side) in which the plot
parameters can be set. These parameters are saved in <a
 href="1Fabricini.htm">Fabric.ini</a>. Further options concern the '<a
 href="3ColouPeriphery.htm">Colour of the periphery'</a>, the '<a
 href="3ColourDiagram.htm">Colour of the diagram'</a>, the '<a
 href="3ColourFrame.htm">Colour of the frame'</a>, and the '<a
 href="3ColourBack.htm">Colour of the background'</a>.<br>
The option '<a href="3Printer.htm">Printer</a>' prints the plot as a
bitmap.</big></p>
