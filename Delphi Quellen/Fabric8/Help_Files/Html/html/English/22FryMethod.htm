<p><big>This method can be applied to find the finite strain when an originally
randomly distributed population of points on a surface is changed by flattening
or shearing. The method will give good results for randomly distributed markers
in a matrix of other material.&nbsp; Completely grain supported fabrics are
not suitable. The manual evaluation is done like this: The centre points
are plotted on a paper. On a transparent paper a point is marked and put
on one point of the paper (Fig. A). The procedure is repeated for all points
(Fig. B). Each time that this point is put over a point of the original plot,
all the other points are copied on the transparency.. The result is an elliptic 
area in the middle of the transparency with no points and a high concentration
of points at the margin of this area. The shape of this area and its orientation
resembles the shape of the strain ellipse (Fig. C). This procedure was programmed.
The user must only create the coordinate matrix for the centre points of
the markers.<br>
