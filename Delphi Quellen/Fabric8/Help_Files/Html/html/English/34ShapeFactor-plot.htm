<p><a name="plotformfaktor"></a><big><b>Plot of the Eigenvalues of
Theoretical and Measured Striations</b></big></p>
<p><big>The principal stress axes <span style="font-family: greeks;">s</span><sub>1</sub>,and
<span style="font-family: greeks;">s</span><sub>3</sub>, found
with the <a href="11Dihedra.htm">dihedra method</a>, are filled in the
fields on the right side of the plot area. Now the theoretical <a
 href="1Striation.htm">striation</a> directions on the measured <a
 href="1Slickensides.htm">slickenside planes</a> are calculated as
maximum resolved shear stresses (<a href="1MRSS.htm">MRSS</a>) for the <a
 href="1ShapeFactor.htm">shape factors</a> R=0.0, 0.1...,1.0. Their <a
 href="1Eigenvalue.htm">eigenvalues</a> are shown in a triangle plot,
together with the eigenvalues of the measured <a href="1Striation.htm">striations</a>.
The <a href="1ShapeFactor.htm">shape factor</a> can be estimated by
comparison of the plot of measured eigenvalues with it's neighbours.
The method is described in <a href="1Literature.htm">Wallbrecher et
al. (1996)</a>.<br>
With the menu "<a href="3Farbe.htm">Colour"</a>‚ the colours of the
theoretical and measured points can be changed.<br>
The menu "<a href="3Diagram.htm">Diagram</a>" contains the same
options as in all the other plot programs.</big></p>
