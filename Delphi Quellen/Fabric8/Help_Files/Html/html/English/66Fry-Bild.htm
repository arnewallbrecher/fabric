When the picture appears on the screen, first the centre of a marker is
clicked, then a point of the margin of the marker. The program
calculates the radius of the marker from these two data. The centre is
found by visual estimate. Continue with all other markers. The
coordinates and the radii of the markers are listed on the right side.</big></p>

in a file.<br>
The colour of the points can be changed with the option "<a
