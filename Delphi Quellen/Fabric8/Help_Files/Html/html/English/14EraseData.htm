<p><big>With this option you can erase data from the plot which
obviously do
not fit into the data set (measurement errors or superposition of more
than one stress field) (<a href="1Literature.htm">Wallbrecher et al.
1996</a>). To do this, you have to know the orientation of the
principal stress axes which can be found with the <a
 href="11Dihedra.htm">dihedra method</a>. <span
 style="font-family: greeks;">s</span><sub>1</sub> and <span
 style="font-family: greeks;">s</span><sub>3</sub>
are filled in the fields on the right side of the plot area. With these
stresses and a <a href="1ShapeFactor.htm">shape factor</a> of the
paleo stress-ellipsoid which has to be estimated, trajectories of the
maximum resolved shear stresses (<a href="1MRSS.htm">MRSS</a>) are
calculated for 316 evenly distributed planes. You can put in two
numbers for the lower and upper limits of the shape factor, so you
receive two sets of trajectories. All data with arrows pointing outside
of these trajectories can be erased by clicking on them. With the
button "Finish correction" the menus "Save" and "Print" become active.
Both sets of data, the erased and the remaining, can be saved in files
and/or printed.<br>
The menu "<a href="3Diagram.htm">Diagram</a>" contains the same
options as the previous programs.</big></p>
