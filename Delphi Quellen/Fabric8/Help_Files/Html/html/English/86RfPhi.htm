<p><b><a name="rf-phi"></a><big>Rf/Phi Method</big></b></p>
<p><big>The Rf/&#966; method is made to analyse strain on objects which were
already elliptical before deformation.The method was establshed by R.
Lisle (1985).<br>
The finite ellipticity (Rf), seen on deformed objects, and the
orientation of the finite ellipse are a result from the primary
(initial) ellipticity (Ri), the orientation of the initial ellipse, and
the ellipticity of the strain ellipse (Rs), and its orientation..
Objects with the same Ri and various orientation show uniform pattern
after affine deformation. These patterns can be described with curves
(Ri-curves) in which Rf is plotted vs. the finite orientation &#966;. An
affine deformation of objects with various ellipticity but identical
orientation also results in defined curves (R<sub>f</sub>/&#966;–curves,&#920;-curves).</big></p>
